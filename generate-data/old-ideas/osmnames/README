Maybe we could use this for data that comes pre-packaged in the app, so that people can search for a city before downloading that state, etc.

Perhaps get this: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/US.zip

Unzip the US.zip file. You could probably find useful things in there. And maybe gzip it? So you can gz parse it like the gazeteer thing.

Where I get other such files: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
Info about it: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt
