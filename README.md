# Building

`spk` only for now. **WARNING** this should be built on an environment you do not mind modifying and risking breaking, etc. This will require installing things on your system and maybe changing things. The main author uses QubesOS and thus has a dedicated VM for this project.

`build.sh` is a TODO. We can probably get this going on `vagrant-spk`. It would also be useful for auto-installing things in this section.

Git submodules, protomaps.js/setup.sh. All of the symlinks within `assets/` should be pointing to something real. build powerbox-http-proxy.

Debian (probably among other things, TODO make this comprehensive and probably put in `build.sh`): `nginx`, `python3-flask`, `python3-unidecode`, `npm`

And then for nginx:

```
sudo service nginx stop
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

Unless you actually want to have an nginx server always running on your system.

Also install golang for the powerbox-http-proxy.

Yeah this is a TODO, feel free to fill this in with useful info.

# Running

## Normal

`spk dev`

## Without Sandstorm

Sometimes useful. I should add some instructions. But it's currently shaky, so not worth documenting since it'll probably change.

But it involves running `./demo.py`. This will start a web server on port 3857 and possibly open a browser.

# Making the data

VERY rough instructions. This will probably not be enough, but it's a starting point so ppl can see where the various parts are.

* Get a region geojson; you can see them in the `regions/` directory or you can make your own (one easy option is on protomaps.com as part of the next step)
* Go to protomaps.com and use the region geojson to export a pmtiles file for the region, or define a new region and extract it. This is the _tiles that are displayed_.
* Use the region to get the search data with the stuff in `geocoding/gazetteer/`. This lets you _search for stuff_.
* Use the search data output and the pmtiles file and go to `package-data/` to make the final downloadable files.

## GeoJSON

### Base map (the "wireframe" look)

* US States https://datahub.io/core/geo-admin1-us
* World https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries

### Downloadable region polygons

As of this writing I've defined the region polygons manually on the protomaps extraction website.

# Map Data

## Search Data (derived from Map Data)

As of this writing, I get large regions (US states, etc) data from https://download.geofabrik.de (who derives it from OpenStreetMap) and extract smaller regions for search.

I'm not sure if this is a requirement for attribution but I do not mind shouting them out!
